ðŸ§  About the Codes

This collection of C programs covers a range of basic yet essential concepts in programming and number/string manipulation. Each file demonstrates logical implementation and algorithmic thinking through simple code examples:

freq_of_alpha.c â†’ Calculates the frequency of each alphabet in a given string.

gcd_of_n_no.c â†’ Finds the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of given numbers.

no_of_vowels.c â†’ Counts the number of vowels present in a string.

palindrome.c â†’ Checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not.

prime_factors.c â†’ Finds and displays the prime factors of a given number.

words_occurrence.c â†’ Counts how many times each word appears in a string.

These programs are great for beginners to understand loops, conditional statements, and string/array handling in C. ðŸš€
